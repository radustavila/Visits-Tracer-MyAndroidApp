# Visits-Tracer-MyAndroidApp

The application will be used in order to track the locations and dates of a user, as well as the names of his friends who accompanied him. Therefore, the application will have in the first fragment a list of user visits, as well as their details. Here will be features for adding and modifying records. Once clicking on an item, the user will be redirected to a fragment where it will be the details about the visits. On the first page I can also integrate the google maps feature to show the locations of the records. Moreover, I could bring the feature to add images using the camera for each location. Other features to be announced...
